<p>The <a href="http://www.willudesign.com/?project=black-dwarf">Black Dwarf</a> is a really cool 100% custom made NAS built by Will Urbina. I like how he designed it such that he's able to easily expand the amount of space that is included, and how easy it is to replace a drive that goes bad. Also it looks phenominal.</p>

<p>I want to do that, but perhaps it's best to start with something smaller. One look at his build video, and it's obvious that he's very skilled at what he does. Someday I'd like to attempt something like that, but there are lots of smaller projects that fit the bill for me right now.</p>

<p>Right now I have an external hard drive bay connected to a Raspberry Pi 2. The bay holds 4 HDs, and has Sata and USB3.0 connections. So I'm set as far as storage is concerned. And the Raspi2 has a quad core processor. It may struggle to encode and stream a high definition video to my smartphone, but I'm certain it could handle most any other task I would throw at it. That is, if only it had gigabit ethernet.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>One of my main goals for this project was to be able to have my entire blu-ray collection available at the press of a button. I want to be able to scroll through my library and select a movie on a slick interface. I use Plex as a media manager, which gives the added benefit of letting me do this remotely too -- I could watch my home movies when I'm on vacation, traveling by bus, etc. And while the raspi2 can certainly handle manipulating files locally, in my experience it was not able to serve up HD quality video using it's 100Mb/s connection.</p>

<p>Luckily, my Steambox does a fantastic job at this.</p>
